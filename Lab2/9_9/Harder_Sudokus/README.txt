These are hard sudokus in increasing level of difficulty.

Note that the method used to evaluate these sudokus in degrees of hardness
is fairly dependent on the (human) techniques that were used to solve them,
so the number of filled cells were not exclusively used. Hence, an extreme 
sudoku could be much easier for a CSP-based algorithm compared to a mortal human.
